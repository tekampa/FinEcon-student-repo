#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES
#   Q1  Reads daily bond PRICES for five bonds, and draws a line graph.
#   Q2  Same for the YIELD TO MATURITY (YTM) of each bond.
#   Q5  Builds a summary table of all five bonds on the last date, sorted by
#       YTM, and a dot plot of the yields.
#
# HOW TO USE IT
#   This code uses the instructor's five bonds. To use your own bonds:
#     1. Put your FactSet exports in bond-assignment/data/ with the same names.
#     2. Edit the table `my_bonds` in Section 1 (CUSIP, ticker, company name).
#     3. Run the script top to bottom.
#   You can ask an AI tool to help adapt the code, but you are responsible for
#   understanding it. If a line is unclear, ask AI to explain that line.
#
#   Lines that start with assert_that() are CODE CHECKS. If something looks
#   wrong (for example, a price of 0.98 instead of 98), the script stops with
#   a message telling you what to look at. Keep these checks in your own code
#   and create more as you deem necessary.
#
# INPUT (in bond-assignment/data/)
#   BondPrices.xlsx  Date + one column per bond, price as PERCENT OF FACE
#   BondYields.xlsx  Date + one column per bond, yield to maturity in PERCENT
#   Each column name looks like
#       United Airlines, Inc. 4.625% 15-APR-2029 (90932LAH0)
#   so the coupon rate, the maturity date and the CUSIP (the bond's ID code)
#   are read from the column name instead of being typed in by hand.
#   Download with as many decimals as FactSet allows: Question 4 needs them.
#
# OUTPUT (written to bond-assignment/output/)
#   fig_*.png                   figures for your slides
#   tab_*.tex and tab_*.md      tables
#   bond_prices_dollars.csv     prices converted to dollars per bond

# ---- 0. Packages -----------------------------------------------------------
# A package is a bundle of extra R commands. Install them ONCE on your
# computer (remove the # at the start of the next line, run it, put the # back):
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readxl", "scales", "assertthat", "here", "knitr"))

# Load the packages every time you run the script.
library(tidyverse)    # data handling (dplyr, tidyr) and graphs (ggplot2)
library(readxl)       # reads Excel files
library(scales)       # formats axis labels (%, $)
library(assertthat)   # assert_that() sanity checks
library(here)         # builds file paths relative to the project folder
library(knitr)        # kable() turns a table into LaTeX or Markdown


# ---- 1. Settings: the only part you should need to edit --------------------

## 7a. Make a presentable copy of the table.
## transmute() keeps only the columns listed and renames them; names with
## spaces or symbols need backticks (`...`). round(x, 2) keeps 2 decimals.
## Coupon: 0.04625 becomes 4.625. Maturity: shown as e.g. 15 Apr 2029.

## 7b. Save as CSV.
write_csv(q5_table, file.path(output_dir, "tab_q5_summary.csv"))

## 7c. Save as LaTeX. kable() writes the table as text in the chosen format;
## writeLines() saves that text to a file. booktabs = TRUE gives the clean
## horizontal rules used in published tables.
q5_latex <- kable(q5_table, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "")

writeLines(q5_markdown, file.path(output_dir, "tab_q5_summary.md"))
